# Blockchain-Based Certificate Generation and Validation Platform

## Overview

This project aims to develop a secure and efficient certificate issuance and validation system using blockchain technology. The platform is designed to streamline the certificate issuance process for various organizations, including educational institutions and government bodies. The core features of the system include:

- Integration with Aadhaar for identity verification.
- Storage of certificates on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralization and immutability.
- QR code integration with a unique IPFS hash for easy certificate validation.
- Third-party validation of certificates by querying the blockchain.

## Features

### Aadhaar Integration

Our platform leverages Aadhaar for identity verification of students and universities, ensuring the authenticity of certificate holders.

### IPFS Storage

All certificates generated on our platform are stored on IPFS, a decentralized and immutable storage system. This ensures that certificates are resistant to alterations and tampering.

## Usage

To use the platform, follow these steps:

1. Register or log in to the platform using your Aadhaar credentials.
2. Generate certificates for students or organizations.
3. Certificates will be stored on IPFS and integrated with a unique QR code for validation.
4. To verify a certificate, scan the QR code, and the blockchain will be queried for authenticity.

## Installation

To set up the platform locally, you'll need the following prerequisites:

- Node.js
- Truffle (for Ethereum blockchain integration)
- IPFS node

Follow these steps to install and run the project:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/capsy14/Blockchain-Based-Certification-and-Validation.git
cd Blockchain-Based-Certification-and-Validation


2. Install dependencies:

npm install


3. Configure your Ethereum node and IPFS settings in the configuration file.

4. Deploy smart contracts to the Ethereum blockchain using Truffle:

Truffle


5. Start the application:
npm start
